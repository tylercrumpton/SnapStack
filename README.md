# SnapStack
Stackable modular board ecosystem for SNAP wireless microcontrollers.

## Ideas
 * The boards while use two rows of extra-tall headers to all the modules to stack.
 * All or most of the modules need to be compatible with each other
 * Should be breadboard-able
 * Try to keep each module cost <$10
 * Reuse PCBs with no-pop parts as much as possible (at least for early runs)
 * Modules that use i2c devices can be autodetected
 
## Interface
 * Two rows of 16-pin tall stackable pin headers for a total of 32 interface pins
  * 24 of the pins will breakout the SNAP module's pins
  * At least one pin will be reserved for a possible 5V power source
  * The other seven will be reserved for future use
